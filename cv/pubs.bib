	abstract = {Machine learning classification of disease based on the gut microbiome often relies on clustering 16S rRNA gene sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to quantify microbial composition. The abundance of each OTU is then used to train a classification model. The standard de novo approach to clustering sequences into OTUs leverages the similarity of the sequences to each other rather than to a reference database. However, such an approach depends on the sequences in the dataset and therefore OTU assignments can change if new data are added. This lack of stability complicates classification because in order to use the model to classify additional samples, the new sequences must be reclustered with the old data and the model must be retrained with the new OTU assignments. The new reference-based clustering algorithm, OptiFit, addresses this issue by fitting new sequences into existing OTUs. While OptiFit can produce high quality OTU clusters, it is unclear whether this method for fitting new sequence data into existing OTUs will impact the performance of classification models. We used OptiFit to cluster additional data into existing OTU clusters and then evaluated model performance in classifying a dataset containing samples from patients with and without colonic screen relevant neoplasia (SRN). We compared the performance of this model to the standard procedure of de novo clustering all the data together. We found that both approaches performed equally well in classifying SRNs. Moving forward, when OTUs are used in classification problems, OptiFit can streamline the process of classifying new samples by avoiding the need to retrain models using reclustered sequences.},

  abstract = {The North American tiger salamander species complex, including its best-known species, the Mexican axolotl, has long been a source of biological fascination. The complex exhibits a wide range of variation in developmental life history strategies, including populations and individuals that undergo metamorphosis; those able to forego metamorphosis and retain a larval, aquatic lifestyle (i.e., paedomorphosis); and those that do both. The evolution of a paedomorphic life history state is thought to lead to increased population genetic differentiation and ultimately reproductive isolation and speciation, but the degree to which it has shaped population- and species-level divergence is poorly understood. Using a large multilocus dataset from hundreds of samples across North America, we identified genetic clusters across the geographic range of the tiger salamander complex. These clusters often contain a mixture of paedomorphic and metamorphic taxa, indicating that geographic isolation has played a larger role in lineage divergence than paedomorphosis in this system. This conclusion is bolstered by geography-informed analyses indicating no effect of life history strategy on population genetic differentiation and by model-based population genetic analyses demonstrating gene flow between adjacent metamorphic and paedomorphic populations. This fine-scale genetic perspective on life history variation establishes a framework for understanding how plasticity, local adaptation, and gene flow contribute to lineage divergence. Many members of the tiger salamander complex are endangered, and the Mexican axolotl is an important model system in regenerative and biomedical research. Our results chart a course for more informed use of these taxa in experimental, ecological, and conservation research.},

  abstract = {Inspired by well-established material and pedagogy provided by The Carpentries (Wilson, 2016), we developed a two-day workshop curriculum that teaches introductory R programming for managing, analyzing, plotting and reporting data using packages from the tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019), the Unix shell, version control with git, and GitHub. While the official Software Carpentry curriculum is comprehensive, we found that it contains too much content for a two-day workshop. We also felt that the independent nature of the lessons left learners confused about how to integrate the newly acquired programming skills in their own work. Thus, we developed a new curriculum that aims to teach novices how to implement reproducible research principles in their own data analysis. The curriculum integrates live coding lessons with individual-level and group-based practice exercises, and also serves as a succinct resource that learners can reference both during and after the workshop. Moreover, it lowers the entry barrier for new instructors as they do not have to develop their own teaching materials or sift through extensive content. We developed this curriculum during a two-day sprint, successfully used it to host a two-day virtual workshop with almost 40 participants, and updated the material based on instructor and learner feedback. We hope that our new curriculum will prove useful to future instructors interested in teaching workshops with similar learning objectives.},

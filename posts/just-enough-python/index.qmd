**TLDR: I made a tutorial: 
[Just enough Python for R users to write advanced Snakemake workflows](https://www.schlosslab.org/just-enough-python/). 
The original intended audience is Schloss Labbies, but anyone who has basic Snakemake
expereince but lacks Python knowledge may find it useful.**

For almost everyone in the Schloss Lab, R is their primary programming language.
I can't speak for Pat, but my understanding of the reason is:

1. Pat knows R.
1. If you write your code in R, Pat and other lab members can help you with bugs in your code.^[Pat on "Why R?": <https://riffomonas.org/minimalR/01_introduction.html#why-r>]

When I joined the lab, Python was my main programming language. 
I had also taken some computer science classes in C++ and dabbled in R for 
statistics classes, but I didn't know R well and hadn't even heard of the tidyverse.
Fortunately, picking up R & the tidyverse packages was a breeze thanks to 
[Pat's learning resources](https://riffomonas.org/)
and other lab members leading [code clubs](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119) 
that showcased cool tips & tricks.

I started using the tidyverse in R for all my data analysis code, but
I kept on using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), 
a Python-based workflow management tool, for writing reproducible workflows.
Fortunately, Pat either didn't mind, or didn't mind _enough_ to tell me to use Make instead. 

Fast-forward several years: not only does everyone in the lab use Snakemake, 
Pat even made a Code Club video teaching intro to Snakemake!

Outside of writing Snakemake workflows, no one aside from me used Python.
We're able to write all of our data analysis code in R and it's possible to 
write good Snakemake workflows with very little knowledge of Python,
so there just wasn't a pressing need for Python.
However, once you begin to take your workflows to an intermediate or advanced level,
learning some Python is very helpful. 
I would even say learning Python is _required_ if you want to understand advanced 
Snakemake tricks, like using lambda functions to define input files based on wildcards.

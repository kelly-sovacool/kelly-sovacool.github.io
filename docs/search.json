I’m interested in developing bioinformatics tools and data analysis pipelines for microbial ecology.  When I’m not in the lab, you might find me volunteering with Girls Who Code, teaching at a Software Carpentry workshop, attending a Data Analysis Networking Group meetup, running or cycling, or moonlighting as a live sound engineer.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I develop bioinformatics tools and data analysis pipelines for microbial ecology and host-associated microbiome research. I’m a fan of open science, open source software, and reproducible research.  When I’m not in the dry lab, you might find me running, cycling, climbing, or otherwise being active outside. I also volunteer with Girls Who Code, teach Software Carpentry workshops, organize events for the Data Analysis Networking Group, and moonlight as a live sound engineer.\n\n   \n \n\n\n\n",
